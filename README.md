# ParserGenerator
A project with a Swing GUI that accpets an alphabet and a formal grammar, and generates a Canonical LR parser for it.
There are options to view the DFA (simple text), the first sets of each symbol and the parsing table. It also checks if a given string belongs to the grammar or not.
A .project file is included so the project can be opened in Eclipse.
